            Oregun High School is a co-educational Lagos State Secondary School located at Kudirat Abiola Way, Oregun-Ikeja. The school was officially commisioned on 26th of September, 1980 with an initial intake of sixty students and four teaching staff.The first
            principal was Mrs S.O Adeogun. She administered the school until her voluntary retirement on the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 1990. After her retirement, the onus of leadership was vested on the vice principal, Mrs W.O Olabitan who
            acted between 1<sup>st</sup> of February, 1990 till 26<sup>st</sup> February 1991 when Rev Mrs M.M Olateju took over. During this period, the students population rose to 1,416 and 54 teaching staff. Rev Mrs M.M Olateju was later transfered.Mrs
            A.F Atanda assumed duty on 1<sup>st</sup> of January, 1997 with 98 teahcers, 10 non-teaching staff and 2,176 students.<br> How ever, the school was split into Junior and Senior scholl on the 6<sup>th</sup> of January 2003. The Senior High
            School, as at 11<sup>th</sup> November 2004 had a population of 738 students. Mrs A.F Atanda stautorily retired from service on the 1<sup>st</sup> of December 2005. This paved way for the appointment and posting of Mrs O.O Akinsete as the
            principal on 3<sup>rd</sup> of January 2006. She had 805 students and 57 teaching staff, and 7 non-teaching staff. She was later transfered. This lead to Mrs I.F kings becoming the principal. She assumed duty on 21<sup>st</sup> of September,

            in the recent years as a result of the Eko Project Fund which is a joint effort with Lagos State Government and World Bank for the purpose of improving the performance of students in 3 core subjects which are Englis Language, Biology and Mathematics.On
            the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2013, Lagos State Ministry of Education represented by Permanent Secretary, Minister of Education commissioned 20 set of computers for digital hubs for the use of both students and teachers. The big field serves
